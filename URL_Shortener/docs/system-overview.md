Designing a URL Shorterner system (like Bit.ly or TinyUrl) involves handling short URL generation, mapping to long URLs, redirection and performance considerations.

1. System Requirements
    * Functional Requirements
        ** Shorten a long URL and generate a unique short URL
        ** Redirect a short URL to its original long URL
        ** Tracking analytics (optional: numbers of clicks, device info ...)
    * Non-Functional Requirements
        ** High availability and scalability 
        ** Effecient storage and retrieval 
        ** Security(prevent abuse, expiration, rate limiting)
2. High-Level Architecture
